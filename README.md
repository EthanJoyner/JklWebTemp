# JKL Preset
### A jekyll environment that fits my work flow to launch websites as quickly as possible.

## Steps for implementation
1. set up the folder you want for git, and git pull
  - You don't need to create a new jekyll env 

2. Delete the sass files. We are team CSS

3. Parse the Premade files in to html sections in the includes sections
  - in the pset sub directory to be specific
--- _includes
|-----pset
      | preset stuff here
| everything else here   

4. 
## Notes
- This works the fastest when you know what css and asset pack you know you are going to use
- label the md files as "!pageName.md" 

## Constant names
#### Html sections
- head.html 
- footer.html
- navbar.html

#### Pages
- elements.html
- index.html
- generic.html
- !elements.md
- !index.md
- !generic.md
- home.html
